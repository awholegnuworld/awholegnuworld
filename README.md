## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a freshman in high school who has been programing since I was 7. I started with Javascript and continued from there. I like to work on blockchain projects and anything decentralized or peer to peer. I enjoy learning about cryptocurrency, mainly Bitcoin, and I stack Sats in my free time. When I'm not programming, I'm reading or playing trumpet in band.
